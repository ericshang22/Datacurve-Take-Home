# Datacurve-Take-Home
Python Code Execution Environment for the Datacurve Take Home assessment
To start, navigate to the backend folder with 'cd backend', then run python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
This should start the Litestar backend on 127.0.0.1:8000

Next, in another terminal navigate to py-executor and run 'npm run dev', which will run on http://localhost:5173/
